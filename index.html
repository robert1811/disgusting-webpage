    <h1>INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND ITS CONSEQUENCES HAVE BEEN A DISASTER FOR THE HUMAN RACE</h1>
    <p>1. The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have
        been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly
        increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in
        “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society,
        have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings
        to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and
        have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The
        continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human being to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world,
        it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical
        suffering even in “advanced” countries.
        2. The industrial-technological system may survive or it
        may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve
        a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but
        only after passing through a long and very painful period
        of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to
        engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine.
        Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will
        be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying
        the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of
        dignity and autonomy.
        3. If the system breaks down the consequences will still
        be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more
        disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is
        to break down it had best break down sooner rather than
        later.
        4. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use
        of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively
        gradual process spanning a few decades. We cant predict
        any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the
        measures that those who hate the industrial system should
        take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against
        that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments
        but the economic and technological basis of the present
        society.
        5. In this article we give attention to only some of
        the negative developments that have grown out of the
        industrial-technological system. Other such developments
        we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not
        mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For
        example, since there are well-developed environmental
        and wilderness movements, we have written very little
        about environmental degradation or the destruction of
        wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly
        important.</p>
